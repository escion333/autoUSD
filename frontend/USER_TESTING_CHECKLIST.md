|-------|---------------|-------|
| test@autousd.com | 0x523c506cdbbd7bc301b39d00643d1b6d21997aca | ✅ |
| alice@autousd.com | 0x44db5252294793460e881d60854ca9441507ccdc | ✅ |
| bob@autousd.com | 0x212781328dee0e41ed0ca053c9eb8cc0d41295f5 | ✅ |
| charlie@autousd.com | 0xd3802a7c29d7c2a4618fe6734283a4acc7529bd6 | ✅ |

## Quick Test Commands

If you want to test via scripts:

```bash
# Test wallet creation
npx tsx scripts/test-circle-wallet.ts

# Test full user flow
npx tsx scripts/test-full-flow.ts

# Create a specific wallet
npx tsx scripts/quickstart-wallet.ts
```

## What's Automatically Handled

✅ **Gasless Transactions** - Built into SCA wallets, no setup needed
✅ **Key Management** - Platform manages all keys
✅ **Gas Sponsorship** - Circle sponsors, bills monthly
✅ **Account Abstraction** - ERC-4337 compliant

## Known Working Features

- ✅ Wallet creation via email
- ✅ Balance queries
- ✅ Wallet persistence
- ✅ Gasless capability (ready for contracts)
- ✅ Multiple user support

## What Needs Contract Deployment

These features need smart contracts deployed to test:
- ⏳ Actual USDC deposits
- ⏳ Withdrawals
- ⏳ Yield tracking
- ⏳ Rebalancing

## Potential Issues to Watch

1. **OTP Flow** - Verify emails arrive and codes work
2. **Session Management** - Check localStorage persistence
3. **Error Handling** - Test with invalid inputs
4. **Loading States** - Ensure smooth UX during wallet creation

## Success Criteria

The integration is successful if:
- ✅ Users can sign up with just email
- ✅ Wallets are created automatically
- ✅ No blockchain complexity exposed
- ✅ Gasless transactions work (when contracts ready)
- ✅ Experience feels like Web2
